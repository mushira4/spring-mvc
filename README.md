# spring-mvc  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mushira4/spring-mvc-sample.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mushira4/spring-mvc-sample)
Samples of Spring MVC + Hibernate

The project is all documented with useful explanations about the main classes of the Spring framework. 
It was made a basic integration with Hibernate, without an explicit declaration of the "persistence.xml", everything was configured using @annotations.

In case of any question or tip please contact me.
